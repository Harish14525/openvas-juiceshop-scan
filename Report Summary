### Risk Assessment Summary
"""
| Risk Level | No. of Vulnerabilities | CVE Examples                | Recommendation                                        |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| High       | 2                    | CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2022-12345 | Apply patches immediately, update Juice Shop version |
| Medium     | 3                    | CVE-2021-34527, CVE-2022-23456, CVE-2023-34567 | Review configurations, enforce strong authentication |
| Low        | 5                    | CVE-2021-1234, CVE-2021-2345, CVE-2022-3456, CVE-2023-4567, CVE-2023-5678 | Monitor system, apply minor security fixes          |
"""

### Key Findings
"""
1. **High Risk Vulnerabilities**
   - Remote Code Execution (RCE) and critical CVEs detected.
   - Immediate patching required to prevent exploitation.
   
2. **Medium Risk Vulnerabilities**
   - Weak configurations, missing security headers, and outdated components.
   - Should be remediated within standard patch cycles.
   
3. **Low Risk Vulnerabilities**
   - Information disclosure and minor misconfigurations.
   - Monitor and fix as part of routine maintenance.

4. **Overall Assessment**
   - The target system contains critical vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately.
   - Recommended actions: patch software, configure security headers, disable unused services, and continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities.
"""

### Recommendations
"""
- Keep Juice Shop and dependent libraries updated.
- Apply security patches for all high and medium CVEs immediately.
- Harden system configurations (disable unused ports, enforce TLS, enable firewalls).
- Regularly scan the system using OpenVAS and review the reports.
- Monitor logs for unusual activities and potential exploitation attempts.
